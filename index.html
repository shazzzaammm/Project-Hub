        I've been programming for a few years, but I'm very new to front-end developement. This
        website is going to be one of my personal projects to learn and practice front-end
        development while displaying my other, less pretty, projects in an easy to access way. Each
        project's source code is available on
        <a href="https://github.com/shazzzaammm" target="_blank">my Github</a>
        (ignore my bad coding practices please). This also serves as an easy way for employers to
        view what I do without being a detective (good <span id="greeting-span"></span> potential employers).

          Here lies the projects that I sometimes work on or just made once and never touched again.
          Some of them are made to be run in the browser, and others are run using other methods
          (rust, python, etc). If there are instructions to install, thats because it will not work
          without it. WARNING Most projects are made for computers and may have incorrect formatting
          and/or function incorrectly when using other devices, use mobile with care.
